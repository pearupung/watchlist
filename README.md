Watchlist is a web application for an instructor to monitor an individual pupil's cue's and actions and provide feedback on them in order to create habits. The pupil has control over who instructs them and what the instructions should be. This is especially useful when the pupil cannot carry a phone to facilitate feedback e.g while driving, dancing, making precision artwork and so forth, or cannot objectively notice their mistakes. Watchlist takes care of these problems by delegating the advisory process to another individual. 

## User flow

#### Starting screen

Starting screen would include basic login for registered pupils and an instructor registering field. When you register as an instructor you will be taken to the instructors UI where one can view cues, actions and feedback to give to the pupil. Upon logging in as a pupil you will be taken to a separate UI where you can view registered instructors, manage your habits and watchlists and start an instruction session.  

### Instructors' UI

Instructors UI comprises only of the advisory part and does not require registering on the site. Consequently the guiding process is with minimal setup on the instructors part which aids faster learning. Firstly, the instructor registers themselves with a username on the starting screen, then they will be taken to the enter code screen, where they can enter the code given by the pupil. After setup they will see a list of triggers and by selecting one, they can pick which action their pupil took. Based on that the instructor will be instructed to give feedback on the next screen.

#### Enter code screen

Here the instructor can enter a code the pupil gave them or cancel their registering. This page shows a timer as well - the instructors list is regularly cleaned of nonactive instructors.

#### Trigger watchlist screen

Here the instructor can view the cues the pupil must react to. When the instructor identifies a cue, they can pick that cue which will redirect them to the actions screen. This screen has a timer and the instructor can end the session when necessary. 

#### Actions screen

Here the instructor can view actions that the pupil may take and select which one the pupil chose to execute. This screen has a timer as well.
